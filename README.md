# **In the name of ALLAH**

## Instruction:
> When you check the repository, you may not see some files. So, my suggestion is to download the repository to avoid the problem.

> *Note: If you know and can code in C++ or, Java language; then you can start from "Beginner Level 02.txt" and after that "Beginner Level 03.txt" file.*

## Practice:
**First if you are completely beginner in programming, check the "Beginner Level 01.txt" file.
After that, check the "Beginner Level 02.txt" file. Then, "Beginner Level 03.txt". After completing the 3 steps, read and follow the instructions of "Competitive_Programming_Guide.pdf".**

## Resource List: 
> You can check "CP_List.xlsx" file.

## Now most important thing is "Time Complexity":
> If you know how to code, then you must know how to calculate the time complexity of a code. So, check the "Big O Notation.txt" file. Whenever you code for a problem, you have to calculate the time complexity. It is one of the best ways to practice it.

## Next one thing is "Space Complexity".
> It is the calculation of memory usage of code.

## For Math Idea & Technique: 
> You can check and read the "Math.pdf" file. Here, you can learn some math tricks.
